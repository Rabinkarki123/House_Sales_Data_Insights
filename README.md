# House Price Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting house prices in Kings County, California, using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to develop a robust model that accurately estimates house prices based on various features and insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Project Overview

In this project, we follow a structured approach to predict house prices, encompassing the following key components:

1. **Data Preparation**: Acquiring and preparing the house sales dataset, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining valuable insights into the dataset through EDA, including visualizations and data summarization. Notable EDA findings include the relationships between house prices and various features.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating polynomial features to capture complex relationships within the data. This enhances the model's ability to capture higher-order interactions.

4. **Model Development**: Building a Ridge regression model with a specified regularization parameter to predict house prices. The model is trained with the transformed data.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance through a combination of train-test split and cross-validation. This includes calculating the RÂ² score as a measure of predictive accuracy.

6. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the project's findings, model performance, and key insights from EDA.
